# Nettserier.no
This repository contains all the code for the Norwegian webcomics portal [Nettserier.no](https://nettserier.no). The website was created in 2006 and has had a couple of updates since then. In 2016, we decided to remake the site from scratch because the code was so heavily outdated, and here's what we've got so far.

## A few notes:
* The repository is made public to provide insight for our users to things like issues, etc. For the moment, though, this repository is **not** open source. Feel free to look at the code and draw inspiration from it, but please don't "steal" it quite yet. (We'll probably make it open source later, and I promise to update this readme file when we do.)
* The project language is badly-written second-language English. For now the only person working on it is Norwegian, and in practice 90+ % of our users use the Norwegian translation of the website, but since nobody can predict the future, we might as well write code (and issues etcetera) in a language the rest of the world can understand. Who knows - perhaps one day the project will have contributors who don't read Norwegian? Probably not. But it's possible.
